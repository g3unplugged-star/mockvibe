Given time, typical pattern: R=18→1+8=9, but code has 6. Could be reverse positions: R=27? Actually A=26,B=25,... Z=1. Then R=9, E=22, D=23. Sum? 9+22+23=54, not 6720. Actually code might be 6 for R, 7 for E, 2 for D, 0 as filler. R=18, 1+8=9? Not 6. R is 18th, 18/3=6! E=5, 5+2=7! D=4, 4/2=2! So pattern: letter position/n or +n.

Maybe 324 is only one not divisible by 4? 324÷4=81, divisible. All divisible by 4. Perhaps 324 is the only one whose digits sum to 9 (3+2+4=9), others sum to 9,13,4,16. Not consistent. Given options, 324 might be the only one not a multiple of 8? 144÷8=18, 256÷8=32, 324÷8=40.5, 400÷8=50, 484÷8=60.5. So 324 and 484 not divisible by 8. So two odd ones. Maybe 324 is the only one not ending with repeated digit pattern? Actually all end with 4,6,4,0,4. So 400 ends with 0. So 400 is odd. But 400 is in options. Question might have typo. Accept 324 as answer based on common SSC pattern: 324 is not a square of a multiple of 4? 18 is not multiple of 4, while 12,16,20,22 are not multiples of 4 either. Actually 12,16,20,22: 16 is multiple of 4, others not. So not that. Given time, choose 324."
